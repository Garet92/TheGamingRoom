# TheGamingRoom
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company looking to expand their web-based game "Draw it or Lose it" to multiple platforms. The Gaming Room wants to know all of the restraints of each platform and recommendations.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
All of the information I provided in this Software Design Template came from best practices and from ideas that have already been proven to work well.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The Software Design document deffinately helped me stay on track when looking at all of the code, it helped me stay on task without straying into making "What-if" ideas to implement into the code.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
The Mobile device recommendations had me at a loss, I think I misunderstood the question and chose to write about what I thought the future could hold on "mobile servers".
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The User provided exact detail as to what they wanted, making it easy to piece together what needs to be done to accomplish that goal. When designing it is important to give the users as close to what they want as possible because without the users there wouldn't even be an application.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I will get more comfortable with using Maven and IDE's alike to ensure that I run the application properly without having to spend a lot of time getting past the first step in creating the code.
